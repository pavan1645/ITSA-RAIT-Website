					Open banking is now a reality. Earlier this month, regulations came into force that will make it much easier for customers of UK banks to access better, cheaper and more personalised products from other providers. <br> <br>In 2016, a report from the government’s competition authority found that large banks weren’t having to compete very hard for customers, and that new providers were effectively being shut out of the market as a result. Because banks haven’t had to treat you well to keep you as a customer, the consequence has been expensive products and poor services. Those who have experienced punitive charges for overdrafts, or who were mis- sold PPI, are well aware of what it is like to be poorly served by the banks.<br><br>So what’s changing?<br><br>
